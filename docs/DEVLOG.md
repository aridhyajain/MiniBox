# Development log

## 2026-10-19 – Phase 0: project setup
- Created `CLAUDE.md` with permanent rules (no git, no sudo, docs mirror source, C11 style).
- Created folders: `src/ include/ scripts/ ui/ tests/ benchmarks/ docs/ rootfs/`.
- Added `.gitignore` (rootfs contents, `.cache/`, build outputs, Python caches, venvs).
- Wrote `scripts/check_env.sh` (kernel, WSL2, cgroup v2 + controllers, user namespaces, tools).
- Wrote `scripts/get_rootfs.sh` (Alpine minirootfs download, sha256 check, prints sudo extraction command).
- Wrote `Makefile` (all, clean, check-env, rootfs) with placeholder build.
- Wrote `README.md` skeleton and `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- Wrote docs: `docs/scripts/check_env.md`, `docs/scripts/get_rootfs.md`, `docs/Makefile.md`.
- No runtime code yet.
